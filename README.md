# Dead-Ops-Arcade
This game was developed by me for my game developing class in college, it heavily references the notorious minigame called "Dead Ops Arcade" found on Call of Duty Black Ops 1 - it is however significantly inferior to the original masterpiece and it doesn't really have anything in common other than the mere concept of being a top-down round/record based zombie shooter. 
The environment it was created on is Unity and the programming language used is C#, a lot of the assets such as prefabs and materials have been scraped from online free sources.
